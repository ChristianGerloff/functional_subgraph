Python Toolbox for Nonnegative Matrix Factorization
====================

This package includes Python implementations (with Numpy and Scipy) of
numerical algorithms for computing nonnegative matrix factorization.

Requirements
------------

Numpy (http://www.numpy.org) and Scipy (http://www.scipy.org) need to be
installed.  Versions of Numpy and Scipy tested with this code were 1.6.1 and
0.9.0, respectively.
